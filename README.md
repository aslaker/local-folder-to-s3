# local-folder-to-s3

## A simple watch script that I created to keep the assets from a specific folder (a board game I'm working on designing) in sync with an S3 bucket.  This was built to alleviate the involved process of uploading my board game assets to table top simulator any time they changed.

## Room for Improvement ðŸ’ª
- Remove all hard coded values and make dynamic
- Add a cli setup script so this can be used for any folder for any reason
